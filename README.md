### Me ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I am an 15 y/o Student. I want to gather some new skills and build some thing useful as a learning project.

## The Project

With this little app I want to address students and give them a platform for school.
In the app you should be able to manage your timetable.
Furthermore, it will soon be possible to add homework.
Another feature should be that you can learn, for example, with cartie cards. 

#
Since this is a freetime project I won't progress too fast. Some future **ideas/plans** you can find here:
- [ ] Share a timetable with friends
- [ ] Learn-Area
  - [ ] Create and share card set
  - [ ] Algorithm that recognizes how well you can handle the respective card and then suggests it to you again later.
- [ ] And many more

### Known Bugs:
- At the moment I am not aware of any serious bugs
